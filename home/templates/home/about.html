            <h3 class="post-title text-center mb-3 pt-3">Background</h3>
            <p class="card-text mx-md-5 px-md-5 mx-sm-1 px-sm-1">Quteba's inception dates several years back. The creator of this platform has many friends in the tech industry who want to know more about the economy. Some of them have been asking him to give them brief introduction on some of the most relevant economics questions and their explnanations.</p>
            <p class="card-text mx-md-5 px-md-5 mx-sm-1 px-sm-1">As strong a motivation to join the tech industry grew in me as my friends were motivated to know economics. I started school in full stack software development at the Code Institute at the end of last year. Quteba is my fourth portfolio project in this program as well as my dream platform where I can teach my friends while engaging them in asking questions and sharing their thoughts in qforum.</p>
